    <p>This is our entry for Jamie Oliver's Search for a Food Tube Star with Uncle Ben's competition. If you're a Singaporean, there's NO CHANCE that you wouldn't know our iconic dish - Chicken Rice.</p>

    <p>We all know that Gordon Ramsay came to Singapore a couple weeks back to compete with our local hawkers, and this dish being one of the competing dishes, became our inspiration to pay tribute to the man himself. ????</p>
    
    <p>With all the days of research done on the ultimate chicken rice, this is our tribute, done THE F WORD STYLE, to Gordon Ramsay. Enjoy</p>
